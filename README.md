1. What goals do you hope to achieve by completing the stated course?
2. <br>
3.What is your intent behind achieving that specific goal?

Alert Box: Whenever a user tries to quit the website, an alert box gets displayed at the top which specifically mentions the goals set by the user. Also, the intent behind achieving those goals mentioned by the user gets displayed. Hence, with this functionality the user in a way gets forced to rethink about his or her vision, brainstorms his or her entire plan of action and in a re-evaluates the current progress.

Login Access denial to the user: If a user attempts to quit the website more than 8 times, he or she would ultimately get logged out and would not be able to access the website until the next 12 hours.
